                    Top 10 Books of 2024
                </p><p>It was a challenging year for your correspondent, personally and ideologically. He did poorly at work, stagnated in his hobbies, and broke up with a pillar of his identity, being informed. One thing keeping him going was his reading, which, while not as prodigious as in the past, was still filled with joyful, challenging works. Here are your correspondent's top 10 books of 2024.</p>
                <p>10: <span style="font-style: italic;">Nobody is Watching You</span> by Janet Malcolm.</p>
                <p>For once, the title says it all. Contributor to <span style="font-style: italic;">The New Yorker, New York</span>, and <span style="font-style: italic;">The Atlantic</span>, Janet Malcolm has profiled Yuja Wang, Eileen Fisher, the owners of Argosy Bookstore, and many others. She has also read and traveled widely; few are as deserving of the title “cultural critic" as she. Collected here are some of her best work; the artists, creatives, and aficionados whose company she keeps could not care less what you think. Just rip out the essay about Constance Garnett and you have a fine collection of nonfiction on your hands.</p>
                <p>9: <span style="font-style: italic;">Table for Two</span> by Amor Towles.</p>
                <p>Amor Towles? Short stories?? Your correspondent had to see them for himself. The man spouting three-page descriptions about grandfather clocks might hardly be the right craftsman for arguably the hardest genre of prose, but he certainly pulled it off. From a hilarious tale of an expert queuer from the early Soviet Union to the delightful comeuppances of slimeballs and misled youth, these stories brim with verve and life. The collection is split into “New York" and “Los Angeles," with the latter being a novella about Eve of <span style="font-style: italic;">Rules of Civility</span> fame. It stands remarkably well on its own, an achievement which anyone who's experienced a limp spinoff can appreciate. For any urbane urbanite among your friends.</p>
                <p>8: <span style="font-style: italic;">The Little Friend</span> by Donna Tartt.</p>
                <p>Even Donna Tartt has middle children, one must suppose. This overlooked masterpiece is arguably Ms. Tartt's most audacious: not in premise nor in breadth, but in sensitivity, tenderness, and suspense. Her other works may be more immediately engaging: <span style="font-style: italic;">The Secret History,</span> the so-called whydunit, naturally lends itself to tension, and <span style="font-style: italic;">The Goldfinch</span> and its globetrotting dramatis personae easily enthrall. But our snarky, wiseass tween and her brother's mysterious, brutal murder make for an indelible six hundred pages. This novel alone would raise any other novelist to at least the backbench of the pantheon.</p>
                <p>7: <span style="font-style: italic;">Claudius the God</span> by Robert Graves.</p>
                <p>On the Vintage edition cover of this novel reads the following blurb: “this book, with or without its predecessor [<span style="font-style: italic;">I, Claudius</span>], is amusing and illuminating to a high degree." It was so dry and stingy in its praise as to be almost insulting (such were book reviews from the 1930s?), but it's entirely accurate. There isn't the same palace intrigue and rapacious relations from Claudius's time surviving under Augustus, Tiberius, and Caligula, but his judicial reforms and conquest of Britain are, against all odds, thrilling and heroic. Your correspondent recommends it, for its own merits as well as its part in Robert Graves's diptych magnum opus. </p>
                <p>6: <span style="font-style: italic;">The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao</span> by Junot Diaz.</p>
                <p>No other novel your correspondent knows of has straddled the Harlem-Upper East Side divide that characterized his high school years so well. On one page, beautiful prose, agonizing tragedy, race relations; on the next, casual sex, pungent marijuana, weightlifting, uber-nerdery. Yes, this bifurcation is intentionally simplistic, even crude, and yet it's worth noting precisely because works which speak to both the Pulitzer committee and the down-and-out of El Barrio are so rare. Those which transcend such divides must be hailed; hail, <span style="font-style: italic;">Oscar Wao</span>, Thane of New Jersey.</p>
                <p>5: <span style="font-style: italic;">The Bone Clocks</span> by David Mitchell.</p>
                <p>Your correspondent has read a good deal of David Mitchell—not just <span style="font-style: italic;">Cloud Atlas</span> but <span style="font-style: italic;">Jacob de Zoet</span> and the novella <span style="font-style: italic;">Slade House</span>—and he spits on genre, convention, and even syntax the way Michael Jordan thrusts his chin at gravity and Roger Federer laughs at 150mph serves. Few people working in the English language in the 21st century have as much ingenuity or brio. The novel spans centuries, features philosophy and magic, and almost shouldn't exist—but we must be grateful and glad it does. Oh, by the way, Mr. Mitchell's entire oeuvre combines into a grand uber-novel: who else alive today would do that!?</p>
                <p>4: <span style="font-style: italic;">The Overstory</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Bewilderment</span> by Richard Powers.</p>
                <p>Two very different novels by another virtuoso. <span style="font-style: italic;">The Overstory</span> concerns a group of disparate souls—each out of joint in their lives in some way—falling in love with trees, or people who love trees, and somehow end up giving their lives for trees and all they represent. <span style="font-style: italic;">Bewilderment</span> is a novella-novel (your correspondent would guess riiight at 50,000 words) told as diary-notes by a widower about? to? his brilliant but neurodivergent son, set against a United States much like ours (dying, dismal, and dingy). Despite their outward differences, they illuminate our endless quest for meaning and gently suggest that, against literal impossibility, the futile protest and microscopic act of kindness still have meaning. Your correspondent will come back to both as we slowly but surely lose our humanity, freedom, and wonder.</p>
                <p>3: <span style="font-style: italic;">Cloud Cuckoo Land</span> by Anthony Doerr.</p>
                <p>A paean to literature and its powers to move us. Your correspondent read it as fast as <span style="font-style: italic;">Babel</span> two years ago—the whole five hundred-ish page novel took two days. And how could it not? Saving ancient manuscripts from the dying city of Constantinople, surviving North Korea as a POW, exploring a virtual reality as detailed and expansive as Earth itself while spending a lifetime inside a spaceship—these are but a subset of the worlds into which we are thrust. Along the way, we learn how wisdom, beauty, and humanity sustain us amidst our direst circumstances, and how we can find them most accessibly and marvelously in literature. <span style="font-style: italic;">Cloud Cuckoo Land</span> is desperately needed and beautifully crafted.</p>
                <p>2: <span style="font-style: italic;">Bullshit Jobs</span> by David Graeber and <span style="font-style: italic;">The Age of Insecurity</span> by Astra Taylor.</p>
                <p>Easily the two most important books your correspondent read this year. Here's a simple question: productivity has risen by many multiples in the last half century. Living standards—except on certain axes like medical treatments—have not. Why aren't we working only ten hours a week? In fact, why are we working more than ever—and feeling worse about it all the while? These two books propose answers to these questions—cogent, tragic, rage-inducing answers. We've been played for fools, and your correspondent no longer has an ounce of restraint or embarrassment for living for his hobbies and his life. </p>
                <p>1: <span style="font-style: italic;">The Prince of Tides</span> by Pat Conroy.</p>
                <p>Critics will sometimes say that books can make you laugh, cry, and gasp; they may even say those books can do them all at once. They're usually wrong—but if they were to say it about <span style="font-style: italic;">The Prince of Tides</span>, they would be terribly underselling the book. Your correspondent would quote large chunks of the novel if he thought it wouldn't try his readers' patience, so good are so, so many quotes and scenes. This book made him root for a man holding a Stradivarius over a balcony ledge, for Chrissakes! But at heart, the novel is about love and its palliative power over unbearable sadness and lifelong agony. Palliative? Yes, because it does not, may not always redeem—but we still need it. Your correspondent would gift it to any reader he knows (with an itty bitty trigger warning) in a heartbeat.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Bonus <> a book not worth reading: <span style="font-style: italic;">The Bridge of San Luis Rey</span> by Thornton Wilder.</p>
                <p>Your correspondent already shat on <span style="font-style: italic;"><a href="review-zevin-t-and-t-and-t.html">Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow</a></span>, but thankfully he read another bad book this year. If this bonus be the Fort Sumter in his war with the Regis English Department, so be it. He recalls once suggesting to his best friend that they read it aloud over the course of an afternoon in Central Park, so storied (ha) was the novel at the school, but he is glad they didn't. The book drags, awfully and impressively; its characters have no bearing or grip on reality; its trite moralisms could be displayed in the Met. It is one of those classics that isn't out of print for sheer inertia.</p>
