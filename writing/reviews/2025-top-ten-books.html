                    Top 10 Books of 2025
                </p><p>
                    Back in 2020, the laxities of Covid allowed your correspondent to accrue a massive book list before an overambitious course load in the fall semester of junior year deterred any reading for the last quarter of the year. This year was similar: a strong start, and then a new job and a return to school stymied much further progress (though matters improved by December, when both occupations somewhat let up). From this up-and-down year, your correspondent presents his top 10 books.
                </p><p>
                    10: <span style="font-style: italic;">The Last Samurai</span> by Helen DeWitt.
                </p><p>
                    Your correspondent couldn't say exactly when this <span style="font-style: italic;">sui generis</span> novel entered his consciousness—he can only say that it never left. After perhaps a decade of hearing "You've got to read this" from as diverse personae as his debate coach and his polymathic Polish friend, he finally picked it up—and fell in love immediately. At the most simplistic, it's a bildungsroman, but it's also a cornucopia of absurd anecdotes, fine arts references, and polyglottery bound together with the twine of Akira Kurosawa's <span style="font-style: italic;">Seven Samurai</span>. It read like attending the most interesting party in the world. It also, like the most interesting party in the world, was disappointingly light in emotional heft. For sheer brilliance, however, your correspondent couldn't recommend it more highly.
                </p><p>
                    9: <span style="font-style: italic;">The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay</span> by Michael Chabon.
                </p><p>
                    <span style="font-style: italic;">The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay</span> is a virtuosic masterpiece: the novel can seemingly do everything. Its characters make you root for them from their first appearance, its plot spans Lithuania to New York to Antarctica, its passion for comic books is not merely tolerable but spirited and inspiring (in the same manner as Donna Tartt's for cabinetry). Mr. Chabon could use some restraint in deploying his colossal vocabulary (your correspondent rarely encounters new words, but "prestidigitate," ten pages in, broke his streak), and his virtuosity sometimes edges too close to bombast. But at his best, the novel whirs along like some perfectly calibrated gyroscope, intimate and yet extraordinary.
                </p><p>
                    8: <span style="font-style: italic;">Cryptonomicon</span> by Neal Stephenson.
                </p><p>
                    This book is the nerdiest your correspondent has ever read in his life. Twinned narratives, from World War II and the dot-com era, zip around each other at the speed of the byte; the dramatis personae include genius cryptographers, intrepid Marines, and shockingly dashing hackers. Expect extended digressions on the Linux kernel, mathematically optimal distributions of inheritances, and designs for gold vaults that double as tombs (alongside thrilling descriptions not of escaping from said tombs, but <span style="font-style: italic;">how</span> the escapes were made possible—for, in the real world, every problem is really a logistics problem). The book—among other things, clocking in around a thousand pages—is not for everyone, but its readers are the few, the proud.
                </p><p>
                    7: <span style="font-style: italic;">The Fraud</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Swing Time</span> by Zadie Smith.
                </p><p>
                    Someone really ought to put Ms. Smith on a banknote, but that would probably mortify her. These two novels—as far as your correspondent can tell, slightly <span style="font-style: italic;">lower</span>-regarded works in her oeuvre—are, in a word, delicious. A true pleasure to read, thought-provoking and witty, and—dare it be uttered—rather sexy. Given this preamble, one might wonder why they are ranked thus, to which your correspondent must report: they lack the emotional gut-punch of the works which rank above them. These characters suffer, but their suffering reveals no untouched truth of the world. Nor need they: they, and these novels, are treasures.
                </p><p>
                    6: <span style="font-style: italic;">The Power Broker: Robert Moses and the Fall of New York</span> by Robert Caro.
                </p><p>
                    Has there been a more tragic text about the greatest city in the world? There are tragedies, and then there is what Robert Moses inflicted on New York City (and environs). And for what?—power that didn't even last his lifetime. The introduction describes Moses' accomplishments—millions of acres of parkland, many of New York's most recognizable bridges, the United Nations and Shea Stadium and countless more structures—alongside his evil—destruction of neighborhoods, ending of careers, blithe racial discrimination. For the first few hundred pages, at every mention of the latter, your correspondent thought, <span style="font-style: italic;">but all those accomplishments</span>. By the end, he saw that even these accomplishments were hollow, and the evils as perfect in the worst possible way: better the man never have lived. As a lover of New York, reading this book felt like being bloodlet.                </p><p>
                </p><p>
                    5: <span style="font-style: italic;">Stoner</span> by John Williams.
                </p><p>
                    (The title isn't what it seems.) An ordinary Midwesterner lives an ordinary life and dies an ordinary death. He will not be remembered. Bookended thus, this novel is, in almost every way, perfect—as some of Mozart's melodies are perfect, or as a perfectly planed slab of beautiful oak is perfect. After finishing it, your correspondent first thought, <span style="font-style: italic;">That's it?</span> And then he thought, <span style="font-style: italic;">That wouldn't be so bad.</span>
                </p><p>
                    4: <span style="font-style: italic;">The Crucible</span> by Arthur Miller.
                </p><p>
                    <span style="font-style: italic;">The Crucible</span> is one of those works that somehow slipped through your correspondent's education; having finally gotten around to it now, he thinks it a first-degree crime that it wasn't part of his curriculum. Few things are more fearsome than the mob, few tragedies as gut-punching as the incrimination of the innocent. The play elevates itself in giving the accusers—mere children fearing punishment—voice and soul; there are no victors, only victims. With its conception during one of America's darkest periods, its potency has only grown as civil servants are fired en masse or subjected to loyalty tests. By its end, if your correspondent were a weeper, he would have wept.
                </p><p>
                    3: <span style="font-style: italic;">Crossroads</span> by Jonathan Franzen.
                </p><p>
                    Your correspondent tried saving this novel until he read its inspiration, <span style="font-style: italic;">Middlemarch</span> by George Eliot. Four years on, he gave up on that dusty doorstop of a book and dove into his favorite author's now-four-year-old novel. Your correspondent plans to write a full-length review; for now, he'll just say it's Mr. Franzen's most heartfelt yet.
                </p><p>
                    2: <span style="font-style: italic;">Another Country</span> by James Baldwin.
                </p><p>
                    One couldn't make James Baldwin write an ugly sentence with a gun to his head. And yet, the writing is one of the less-noticed parts of this obscenely intimate novel. Yes, intimacy can be obscene; obscenity can be intimate. Detailing relationships of all sorts—black men with white women, white men with black women, black men and white men—the novel traverses territory scarcely describable, for lack of words and lack of eloquence, with grace and mercy. If one were to say James Baldwin was the greatest writer of the twentieth century, your correspondent wouldn't even flinch.
                </p><p>
                    1: <span style="font-style: italic;">A Prayer for Owen Meany</span> by John Irving.
                </p><p>
                    <span style="font-style: italic;">A Prayer for Owen Meany</span> accomplishes a few things. It is a bildungsroman—without being absolutely, nauseatingly insufferable. (Looking at you, Salinger and Ferrante and Knausgaard and on and on.) It is, on almost every page, religious—without ever suggesting anything inherently good about religiosity. (Mr. Franzen's <span style="font-style: italic;">Crossroads</span> might have ranked higher if it pulled this off.) It is a total riot, it is deeply discomfiting, and it has a crackerjack plot twist on the last page, so check the page count with care. It makes you sit back and reconsider your life after you finish it. And then it makes you want to immediately reread it. Well—what are you waiting for?
                </p><p>
                    Bonus <> a book not worth reading: <span style="font-style: italic;">The Fellowship of the Ring</span> by J. R. R. Tolkien.
                </p><p>
                    No, your eyes are not fooling you: the progenitor of all fantasy fiction is not worth reading. It is overwrought an unwieldy, its characters are flat as cardboard, and its plot makes no sense. To distinguish plot from premise: your correspondent takes no issue with the Ring, or its potency, or its being found by Smeagol, or any of the other contrivances; he is happy to take them at face value. But the band of merry hobbits bump into incidental characters, quaff and gorge on every other page, and, one-third of the way into the book, still haven't met Aragorn. (Peek at the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fellowship_of_the_Ring#%22Groping_for_a_story%22">"Groping for a story"</a> section of the Wikipedia page for more.) Allegedly, C. S. Lewis told Tolkien to, essentially, trim the fat—for once, the man was right.
