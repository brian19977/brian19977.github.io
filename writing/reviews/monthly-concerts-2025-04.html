                    On Alban Gerhardt, 6 April 2025:
                </p><p>
                    What is the best way to appreciate the Cello Suites by Johann Sebastian Bach?
                </p><p>
	                First: the smaller the hall, the better. The cello is a delicate, sensitive instrument. Forcing a large sound from it can only make it scratchy, uncouth. It must be allowed to sing, to whisper, to murmur. A solo cello recital in Stern Auditorium would be ill-advised.
                </p><p>
                    Second: a few at a time. Each suite is woven from the same template: prelude, allemande, courante, sarabande, a two-part dance like a minuet, and a gigue. Finding individuality among the similarity is challenging; all six at once can be an anesthetic.
                </p><p>
                    And yet: this set constitutes the Everest of any cellist. Why climb it? "Because it's there"—and so Mr. Alban Gerhardt, the eminent German cellist, tackled the set at the 92nd St. Y.
                </p><p>
                    A note on the organization: most cellists take an intermission between the third and fourth suites, or two intermissions—after the second and the fourth. Mr. Gerhardt took just one—but between the fourth and fifth. This puzzled your correspondent until he realized that the fifth suite calls for <span style="font-style: italic;">scordatura</span>—the tuning of strings to non-standard pitches; in this case, the highest string, normally A, is tuned down to G. All the same, your correspondent would have welcomed an intermission after the second suite.
                </p><p>
                    Rather than trod over all 36 movements, then, some general observations. Mr. Gerhardt was, above all, energetic. Melodies soared; chords thrummed; passagework was devoured by the section. Courantes and gigues, therefore, were his strong suits. Also strong were his sarabandes: his instrument, to your correspondent's ear, had a mellower, broader sound than other solo cellos he's heard (which, to be fair, aren't too numerous). His sarabandes were also slower than typical, which contributed to the effect.
                </p><p>
                    Technically, Mr. Gerhardt was choppier than expected. His intonation was great, if not excellent; his rubato was excessive, but your correspondent favors clean, simple lines in his cello suites, so this may be a matter of taste. His tone was, frankly, rough—the somewhat sandpapery, scratchy texture of an under-rosined bow and overeager strokes. He missed many notes, which is of course part of the fun of live performances—but there comes a point where the frequency begins to affect the music. And his memory slips—there were quite a few, notably one where he even grunted, "Ah, no!" after a few false restarts and went back to the start of the movement.
                </p><p>
                    There is no perfect way to perform the cello suites, and your correspondent applauds any cellist who dares to do so at all. After two and a half hours of Bach, Mr. Gerhardt completed the set; to it, he added a spritz of joviality: Mstislav Rostropovich's "Moderato"—eons past what Bach might have written, but fun all the same. 
                </p><p style="text-align: center;">

                </p><p id="concert2">
                    On Yunchan Lim, 25 April 2025:
                </p><p>
                    The Goldberg Variations ("Goldbergs"), BWV 988, by Johann Sebastian Bach are a peak infrequently attempted. Many of the greatest pianists of our time never played them (as far as your correspondent can tell): not the powerhouses, Kissin and Argerich; nor the intellectuals, Pollini and Brendel; not even the GOATs, Richter and Horowitz. And little wonder: around 80 minutes with all repeats, constantly shifting moods, the vast majority unrelenting G Major (ugh).
                </p><p>
                    Instead, by specialists: Wanda Landowska and Rosalyn Tureck, the high priestesses of Bach; Gould, of course; Schiff and Hewitt and Dinnerstein. And a few, particularly ambitious pianists, venturing outside their comfort zone: the affable Jeremy Denk, Gilmore-winner Alexandre Tharaud, and ravishing Beatrice Rana.
                </p><p>
                    Recently, three superstars of pianism have taken it on: Víkingur Ólafsson, who brought a cool, blue, crystalline perfection to the work; Lang Lang, virtuosic and surprisingly intimate—his best recording ever; and now Yunchan Lim, showered with every adoration conceivable, touring the Goldbergs after rocketing to fame with its antipode, Liszt's Transcendental Études. 
                </p><p>
                    Early drafts of Mr. Lim's program included the <span style="font-style: italic;">Variationen,</span> op. 27, by Anton Webern, a five-minute twelve-tone diddy that your correspondent is glad he struck from his program. There are two options, in his view, to programming the Goldbergs: a full first half,<sup>[<a id="en1src" href="#en1">1</a>]</sup> or nothing.
                </p><p>
                    Anyhow: Mr. Lim gave one of the best performances of the Goldbergs your correspondent has heard—and one surely in contention to be the best concert he attends this year. Taking every repeat, Mr. Lim injected life and verve into every variation—not giving a single one short shrift, but caressing and adoring each one's unique sparkle or warmth. His ornamentation was playful yet tasteful; his rubato never misjudged. With his "Pictures at an Exhibition" and his Études (the aforementioned Liszt as well as his Chopin, opp. 10 and 25), he asserted himself a font of bravura. Last night, his maturity and subtlety elevated him from the rabble of superstars to the dais of artists.
                </p><p>
                    Emerging in a dinner suit (refreshing to see a musician in something that doesn't look like silk pajamas), Mr. Lim settled in, letting silence take over, before beginning the Aria. It was perfectly calibrated: <span style="font-style: italic;">piano,</span> but with heft; not dragging; and with a singing line. It was delicious to hear the repeats.
                </p><p>
                    From the first variation, Mr. Lim showed the kind of Goldbergs he had in store: jaunty, articulate, with humor and color in abundant supply. On each repeat, his embellishments added to the already marvelous music; they did not come off as at all mannered, but truly spontaneous, improvisatory. Aside from the full range of trills and grace notes, he added little flourishes to bridge repeats, raised passages up an octave for a tinkling, music box effect, and even lowered them an octave for a warm, husky timbre.
                </p><p>
                    His technical chops made it such that the requisite virtuosity of many variations felt completely natural. The fourteenth variation, with long trills followed by scampering figuration up and down the keyboard, had the air of children shrieking with joy chasing a squirrel—a Baroque "Tuileries" if there ever was one. And the twenty-third, one of your correspondent's favorites, had particular genius. Sir András Schiff plays it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0tkUWK0u4Y&ab_channel=B-sharp" target="_blank">"cutely"</a>—all bouncing parallel thirds—which is a fine interpretive decision. But Mr. Lim gave those thirds real drama—lurching and rising, punctuated by bass notes doubled to octaves. The juddering clashes between hands at the end rose almost to atonality.
                </p><p>
                    His superlative ease, in fact, overwhelmed some variations. The fifth and twenty-sixth, with winding scales alongside tricky accompaniment—if the twenty-third is "Tuileries," the twenty-sixth is Bach foreseeing "L'Escalier du Diable"—had none of the acidic punch of Gould; whether it be excessive pedal or overshined pearlescence, both variations faded into a burbling pleasantness. The sixteenth—the grand "French Overture" variation commencing the second half—was played like any other: beautiful, and nothing but: no sense of struggle, no bursting joy, no "here we go again." Dare your correspondent say Mr. Lim doesn't know struggle? He surely does, but he doesn't oft show it: smiling during "Feux Follets" and all that. Finishing half the Goldberg Variations certainly didn't  seem to fatigue him.
                </p><p>
                    But these are small complaints for such a fabulous recital. The minor-keyed variations, especially the "black pearl" twenty-fifth, sustained their lament and pathos throughout; both Mr. Olafsson's and Mr. Lang's interpretations (albeit on album) dragged, but Mr. Lim's certainly did not. The Quodlibet—the final variation, breaking the pattern of canons on every third variation and therefore heralding the end of the set—had all the ecstasy missing from the Overture. And the Aria da Capo? We, irreparably and beautifully changed after the Goldberg Variations, returned to the same notes; we returned to the same notes, and we found them good. The ovations went on and on.
                </p><p>
                    [Written 2025]
                </p><p id="en1" style="font-size: 80%;">
                    <a href="#en1src">1.</a> Sir András Schiff once programmed a Carnegie recital with the Goldbergs as the first half—all repeats included—and the Diabelli Variations as the second half. Oh, and he played an encore of op. 111's Arietta. Absolute madman.
