                    On Hayato Sumino, 18 November 2025:
                </p><p>
                    Most classical pianists these days garner their debuts in the world’s great halls thanks to medaling performances at prestigious competitions. These include the Chopin, most famously (Zimerman, Pollini, Argerich, and countless others); Tchaikovsky (Van Cliburn, Sokolov); Leeds (Lupu, Perahia); and so on.
                </p><p>
                    A select few, however, receive their invitations because their rejection from those competitions causes such a stir as to make headlines. Ivo Pogorelich, the Croatian terminator, is the most famous example: Martha Argerich famously resigned from the jury of the 1990 Chopin Competition after Pogorelich failed to make the Final Round and called him a “genius.”
                </p><p>
                    Hayato Sumino may well be the second such pianist, being eliminated from the 2021 Chopin Competition, but, instead of Martha Argerich, he has 1.5 million YouTube subscribers on his side. To his—and their—credit, his Chopin Competition performances were idiosyncratic, interesting, and expressive. They were also lacking in focus at times, which your correspondent guesses did him in during the grueling, hour-long Third Round.
                </p><p>
                    Mr. Sumino’s popularity has only grown since, and a successful recital tour of Japan led him to 57th Street, where he offered a recital of Bach and Chopin mixed with jazzy numbers and his own work. His interpretation of the traditional works was barely ordinary, with only moments of bravura; however, in the second half, where his heart clearly lay, he brought the fresh and joyful playing that has become his trademark.
                </p><p>
                    The works by Bach unfortunately seemed muddled through; there seemed little indication of his interest beyond generous ornamentation throughout. The Prelude in Fugue in C Major from the Well-Tempered Clavier, Book II, opened the evening; the prelude is such a rich, grand work, but Mr. Sumino didn’t relish in that richness. The fugue, meanwhile, was practically jogged through. As for the C Minor Partita, the opening Sinfonia (marked “Grave”—slow, serious, almost funereal) became merely plodding, the Sarabande almost literally put your correspondent to sleep, and the Capriccio had none of its capriciousness (Sir András Schiff characteristically called it “drunkenness”)—no punchy bass, no jaunty rhythmic offset, no flying-off-the-tracks speed.
                </p><p>
                    His selection of Chopin consisted of the Nocturne in C Minor, op. 48 no. 1, the vastest of the Nocturnes, and the Scherzo no. 1 in B Minor, op. 20, a darkly writhing, virtuosic work. His nocturne was creditable, with somberness expressed in carefully voiced octaves and doleful melodies, while the ecstatic middle section did take flight (if not reach exit velocity). His Scherzo presented another missed opportunity: with so much interpretive freedom, he instead chose the most ordinary route—as if he were still trying to please a Warsaw jury, rather than playing to a sold-out hall in New York.
                </p><p>
                    After intermission, he opened with Austrian eccentric Friedrich Gulda’s Prelude and Fugue, vaguely modeled off Bach’s of the same key from Book I of the Well-Tempered Clavier. Maybe Mr. Sumino had had a shot of espresso, or finally gotten to something he wanted to play: it had all the liveliness missing from that Capriccio and featured his own cadenza to boot.
                </p><p>
                    Some of Mr. Sumino’s music followed: “New Birth,” referencing Chopin’s étude op. 10 no. 1, and “Recollection,” referencing his Ballade in F Major. “New Birth” was the same technique from the study with a new harmonization—enjoyable, but not much more. “Recollection,” however, took the humming, lullaby-esque first theme of the Ballade and added swirling flourishes and grinding bass notes, all with a hazy texture owing to, if pressed to guess, a large mute placed across the strings. The title was perfect, as if remembering a tune from childhood long lost, sung in a school long demolished, by a friend long drifted. It only helped that it was played on an upright piano, brought out during intermission: the flatter, brighter timbre added to the sense of decay, the sonic equivalent of a faded Polaroid.
                </p><p>
                    Mr. Sumino’s selection of Kapustin études were also very in character: brisk and jocular, mixing the discordant harmonies of mid-century Soviet music with the irrepressible life of jazz. His own set of three nocturnes, however, were the most disappointing of the second half: simple melodies and miasmas of chords evoked Ludovico Einaudi’s anhedonic mush, music made painkiller. Saying it could serve as film music would be doing a disservice to that venerated tradition, from Korngold to Shostakovich to Göransson.
                </p><p>
                    The highlight was certainly Ravel’s <span style="font-style: italic;">Boléro.</span> Wait, what? Yes: Mr. Sumino arranged Ravel’s spiraling work into possibly the single coolest thing your correspondent has seen on a stage. The upright had one key muted to a toneless tap, for the snare drum, and Mr. Sumino was off to the races: playing the melody while tapping the “snare drum,” he slowly added harmonies, voices, and embellishments.
                </p><p>
                    To give you a sense of how hard this is: try simply tapping the snare drum part on a table with your finger. Got that? Great, now add in the melody—just sing it. Your correspondent, for one, crashes out after just a few bars. Mr. Sumino pulled off this almost unbelievable feat with ease and brio; it was the perfect capstone to his recital.
                </p><p>
                    There followed three encores: the Chopin étude on which “New Birth” is based, another bouncy jazz work, and his own symphonic variations on “Twinkle Twinkle Little Star”—“I think you’ll recognize the melody,” he quipped dryly. The evening certainly had people on their feet by the end, and while it was choppy at times, Mr. Sumino, like any good showman, knew to save best for last. Your correspondent, for one, has liked and subscribed.
