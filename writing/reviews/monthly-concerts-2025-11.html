                    On Kyung-Wha Chung and Kevin Kenner, 7 November 2025:
                </p><p>
                    Carnegie Hall was graced by two underappreciated luminaries, violinist Kyung-Wha Chung and pianist Kevin Kenner, for an evening of Schumann, Grieg, and Franck. It was a treat to see them where they belong: on New York's biggest recital stage.
                </p><p>
                    Kyung-Wha Chung is a trailblazing violinist who won joint gold with Pinchas Zuckerman at the 1967 Leventritt Competition—possibly the first Asian to win an award of such stature. Her career was going strong in its fifth decade when a combined shoulder-wrist injury left her unable to play for over five years. Rather than retreat to teaching and stability, she practiced the sonatas and partitas for solo violin by Bach in her mind every day of her injury. Fifty years after her competition victory, she toured the world performing the complete set, indubitably the single most difficult feat of violin virtuosity.
                </p><p>
                    Kevin Kenner has the dubious honor of <span style="font-style: italic;">primus inter pares</span> at the 1990 Chopin Competition: he medaled silver, but there was no gold medalist. The experience—of being deemed less than Krystian Zimerman and Martha Argerich—took him decades to move past; the joke is on the Chopin Competition, which neglected to reward a pianist of delicate and noble musicality and then invited him as a juror for the 2025 edition.
                </p><p>
                    On the evening of the recital, your correspondent's teaching obligations ran long; by the time he made it to Carnegie Hall, the first half was nearly over. The minute of the Grieg Sonata's coda he heard over the speakers heralded a magnificent second half to come, and he was right. Chung and Kenner's Franck Sonata was at turns mellow, soaring, and heartbreakingly beautiful; their complementary sensibilities were perfectly suited to this cornerstone of the repertoire.
                </p><p>
                    A note about the Franck Sonata. It's a glorious work, and a strange one: overflowing with transcendent melodies which recur and intertwine across four movements, peaks of drama without clear climaxes, a false ending at the close of the second movement, all over the span of around half an hour—long by violin sonata standards. One could say without reservation that it's the greatest work written for solo violin—but it's not interpretation-proof: no less an eminence than <a href="240403-240411-weilerstein-ma.html">Yo-Yo Ma</a> has failed to make this sonata "work."
                </p><p>
                    The opening of the Franck Sonata demonstrated Ms. Chung and Mr. Kenner's musicianship: the former, leading with brave, heart-on-sleeve lyricism; the latter, following with gentle, unintrusive accompaniment. Reviewers often write how the opening of a performance sets the tone for the whole; your correspondent tends to find this simplistic, but here it couldn't apply better.
                </p><p>
                    Ms. Chung's playing has always been praised for its singing line, devoid of overintellectualizing; in her golden years, these qualities have only magnified. Phrases were never clipped and always caressed; every crescendo and decrescendo reached to the end of the line, rather than petering out partway through. There were some problems with intonation, especially at entrypoints, but given how awkward the violin part is—often starting high on the fingerboard and leading directly into unintuitive sequences—your correspondent happily overlooked these slips.
                </p><p>
                    Mr. Kenner, meanwhile, served as the perfect accompanist; his tone rarely rose above forte, even in the tempestuous second movement; in a work with so much internal drama (harmonic, structural), though, less bombast is always preferable to more. His phrasing consistently matched Ms. Chung's, and the clarity of his textures allowed the violin to project, rather than get muddled up with a soupy tone.
                </p><p>
                    The third and fourth movements—always the more enjoyable movements, with the grandly tragic melody making prominent entrances and the setup from the earlier movements paying off—were everything they should be. The third movement had a lustrous, dark tone, like polished obsidian; the fourth, shifting from tentatively to boldly heroic, allowed both to finally show their bravado. Their studio recording muted both of these qualities; their live performance had all the spontaneity missing from the manicured, slightly dull album.
                </p><p>
                    After the work ended, they received adoring cheers from the substantially-Korean audience; Ms. Chung, after all, has three generations of fans. Your correspondent appreciated Mr. Kenner so gallantly playing second fiddle; Ms. Chung surely did too: after she received a bouquet of white roses, she plucked one and placed it between Mr. Kenner's teeth. The scene was as perfect as their two encores, Debussy's “Beau Soir” and Schubert's Sonata in D Major. Your correspondent looks forward to their future performances—Ms. Chung with an orchestra, Mr. Kenner with a Carnegie stage just to himself, after all these years.

                    On Hayato Sumino, 18 November 2025:
                </p><p>
                    Most classical pianists these days garner their debuts in the world's great halls thanks to medaling performances at prestigious competitions. These include the Chopin, most famously (Zimerman, Pollini, Argerich, and countless others); Tchaikovsky (Van Cliburn, Sokolov); Leeds (Lupu, Perahia); and so on.
                </p><p>
                    A select few, however, receive their invitations because their rejection from those competitions causes such a stir as to make headlines. Ivo Pogorelich, the Croatian terminator, is the most famous example: Martha Argerich famously resigned from the jury of the 1990 Chopin Competition after Pogorelich failed to make the Final Round and called him a “genius.”
                </p><p>
                    Hayato Sumino may well be the second such pianist, being eliminated from the 2021 Chopin Competition, but, instead of Martha Argerich, he has 1.5 million YouTube subscribers on his side. To his—and their—credit, his Chopin Competition performances were idiosyncratic, interesting, and expressive. They were also lacking in focus at times, which your correspondent guesses did him in during the grueling, hour-long Third Round.
                </p><p>
                    Mr. Sumino's popularity has only grown since, and a successful recital tour of Japan led him to 57th Street, where he offered a recital of Bach and Chopin mixed with jazzy numbers and his own work. His interpretation of the traditional works was barely ordinary, with only moments of bravura; however, in the second half, where his heart clearly lay, he brought the fresh and joyful playing that has become his trademark.
                </p><p>
                    The works by Bach unfortunately seemed muddled through; there seemed little indication of his interest beyond generous ornamentation throughout. The Prelude in Fugue in C Major from the Well-Tempered Clavier, Book II, opened the evening; the prelude is such a rich, grand work, but Mr. Sumino didn't relish in that richness. The fugue, meanwhile, was practically jogged through. As for the C Minor Partita, the opening Sinfonia (marked “Grave”—slow, serious, almost funereal) became merely plodding, the Sarabande almost literally put your correspondent to sleep, and the Capriccio had none of its capriciousness (Sir András Schiff characteristically called it “drunkenness”)—no punchy bass, no jaunty rhythmic offset, no flying-off-the-tracks speed.
                </p><p>
                    His selection of Chopin consisted of the Nocturne in C Minor, op. 48 no. 1, the vastest of the Nocturnes, and the Scherzo no. 1 in B Minor, op. 20, a darkly writhing, virtuosic work. His nocturne was creditable, with somberness expressed in carefully voiced octaves and doleful melodies, while the ecstatic middle section did take flight (if not reach exit velocity). His Scherzo presented another missed opportunity: with so much interpretive freedom, he instead chose the most ordinary route—as if he were still trying to please a Warsaw jury, rather than playing to a sold-out hall in New York.
                </p><p>
                    After intermission, he opened with Austrian eccentric Friedrich Gulda's Prelude and Fugue, vaguely modeled off Bach's of the same key from Book I of the Well-Tempered Clavier. Maybe Mr. Sumino had had a shot of espresso, or finally gotten to something he wanted to play: it had all the liveliness missing from that Capriccio and featured his own cadenza to boot.
                </p><p>
                    Some of Mr. Sumino's music followed: “New Birth,” referencing Chopin's étude op. 10 no. 1, and “Recollection,” referencing his Ballade in F Major. “New Birth” was the same technique from the study with a new harmonization—enjoyable, but not much more. “Recollection,” however, took the humming, lullaby-esque first theme of the Ballade and added swirling flourishes and grinding bass notes, all with a hazy texture owing to, if pressed to guess, a large mute placed across the strings. The title was perfect, as if remembering a tune from childhood long lost, sung in a school long demolished, by a friend long drifted. It only helped that it was played on an upright piano, brought out during intermission: the flatter, brighter timbre added to the sense of decay, the sonic equivalent of a faded Polaroid.
                </p><p>
                    Mr. Sumino's selection of Kapustin études were also very in character: brisk and jocular, mixing the discordant harmonies of mid-century Soviet music with the irrepressible life of jazz. His own set of three nocturnes, however, were the most disappointing of the second half: simple melodies and miasmas of chords evoked Ludovico Einaudi's anhedonic mush, music made painkiller. Saying it could serve as film music would be doing a disservice to that venerated tradition, from Korngold to Shostakovich to Göransson.
                </p><p>
                    The highlight was certainly Ravel's <span style="font-style: italic;">Boléro.</span> Wait, what? Yes: Mr. Sumino arranged Ravel's spiraling work into possibly the single coolest thing your correspondent has seen on a stage. The upright had one key muted to a toneless tap, for the snare drum, and Mr. Sumino was off to the races: playing the melody while tapping the “snare drum,” he slowly added harmonies, voices, and embellishments.
                </p><p>
                    To give you a sense of how hard this is: try simply tapping the snare drum part on a table with your finger. Got that? Great, now add in the melody—just sing it. Your correspondent, for one, crashes out after just a few bars. Mr. Sumino pulled off this almost unbelievable feat with ease and brio; it was the perfect capstone to his recital.
                </p><p>
                    There followed three encores: the Chopin étude on which “New Birth” is based, another bouncy jazz work, and his own symphonic variations on “Twinkle Twinkle Little Star”—“I think you'll recognize the melody,” he quipped dryly. The evening certainly had people on their feet by the end, and while it was choppy at times, Mr. Sumino, like any good showman, knew to save best for last. Your correspondent, for one, has liked and subscribed.
